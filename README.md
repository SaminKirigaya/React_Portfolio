## Cautions And Optimization

- Kindly remember that all the images used in here not allowed to be used in your site or any application or software. They are copyright issued.

- The whole site runs temporaryly at my localhost so when you are willing to use the code and move your images in the working consition set them according to your server.

- You are not allowed to use any of the certifications as demo or design in your page. 

- Kindly give me a credit if you are using this design.
